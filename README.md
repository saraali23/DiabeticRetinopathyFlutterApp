# DiabeticRetinopathyFlutterApp
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection Flutter app which uses two deep learning models to predict presence and grading of DR
The App is still incomplete, but the classification part is complete.
Used Tflite_flutter library to deploy custom models
I just created and inegrated the models into the application , my friends designed the themes, icons and the other parts.
