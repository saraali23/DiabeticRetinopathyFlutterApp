# DiabeticRetinopathyFlutterApp
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection Flutter app which uses two deep learning models to predict presence and grading of DR
The App is still incomplete, but the classification part is complete.
Used Tflite_flutter library to deploy custom models
I JUST deployed the models , my friends designed the themes and icons and the other parts.
